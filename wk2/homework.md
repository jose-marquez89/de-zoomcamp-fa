# Homework 2
For the sake of time and because I also want to dip into Airflow, I'm only doing the first 3 homework problems. The other homework problems are very Prefect specific and 
while good practice, can be something you learn on the job.

## Question 1
The dataset in question has `447,770` rows.

## Question 2
The following cron setting will run a job at 5am UTC on the first day of every month: `0 5 1 * *`

### Question 3
My row count says about 14M, which is a bit off from the homework prompt, but I'm chalking this up to updates to the repository
